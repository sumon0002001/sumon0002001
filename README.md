### Hi there 👋
Rawshan-@Sumon0002009
Hi, I'm Rawshan-a remote software developer specialized in fullstack developer. I love coding. I love playing Cricket. I worked on different projects in different companies. I have some projects here in Github. Sometimes I have fun making javascript games. 

My values
💖 Safety and trust
🌟 Expression as authentic self
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity
🙌 Shared norms
🚀 Elevate the underrepresented

How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
